annotated_FastDFS
=================

annotate  fastdfs_v1.29 in Chinese
FastDFS is a distribute file system writen by yuqing, 
you can find the orginal source code here:
https://code.google.com/p/fastdfs/ 

Inorder to make it clear how it works, I annotate it
in Chinese, you can contact me by huangkq1989@gmail.com

I am looking for an intership, will be appreciated to your offer:)

PS:
php_client is a php extention of fastdfs, it's the php function wrapper of 
fastdfs client. And the source files in test directory are some test codes.
I am not going to annotate these source files in these two directorys.
